## Problem or motivation

A clear description of the problem you're trying to solve or the workflow you want to improve. Example: "I'm always frustrated when [...]"

## Proposed solution

A clear description of what you want to happen. How would this fit into the existing `object:verb` command structure (e.g. a new command under `items:`, `config:`, etc.)?

## Alternatives considered

Any alternative solutions or workarounds you've considered.

## Context

- Does this align with stud-cli's scope (Jira read-only + Git workflow)? See [README – Architectural Principles](https://github.com/studapart/stud-cli#architectural-principles).
- Is this related to an existing command (e.g. `stud submit`, `stud items:list`)?

## Additional context

Screenshots, examples from other tools, or links to Jira/Git documentation if relevant.
